The project aims to revolutionize hashtag recommendation and short description generation on social media platforms by leveraging deep learning techniques and multimodal data integration. It employs an encoder-decoder architecture to seamlessly combine textual and visual information for hashtag recommendation, enhancing content visibility and engagement. Through meticulous feature extraction using models like Inception V3 and Universal Sentence Encoder, the system comprehensively understands both image and text inputs. The hashtag prediction module optimizes relevance through multimodal fusion, while the short description generation module crafts diverse narratives using ResNet50's feature extraction capabilities. The methodology is validated using datasets like MM-INS, NUS-WIDE, and Stanford Dataset, ensuring robust performance and generalizability across various content types and platforms. By addressing the dual challenges of hashtag recommendation and short description generation, the project offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing content understanding and retrieval in multimodal environments, marking a significant advancement in social media interaction and informationÂ retrieval.
