The Landslide Prediction System employing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and
a Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph aims to address the challenges associated with ac-
curate landslide prediction. The systemâ€™s architecture integrates XAI techniques, such
as LIME and SHAP values, enhancing model interpretability and transparency. Addi-
tionally, a Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph is constructed to capture dynamic environ-
mental factors, providing a comprehensive representation of spatial and temporal data.
Machine learning models, selected based on predictive performance, undergo training and
validation, with real-time monitoring enabling early detection and alerting mechanisms
for timely notifications.
